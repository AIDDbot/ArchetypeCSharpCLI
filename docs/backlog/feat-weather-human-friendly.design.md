# Enhanced Human-Friendly Weather Report — Design

## Overview

This feature upgrades the weather command output to be more visually engaging and informative. It introduces emojis for weather conditions and units, and expands the report to include wind, temperature, humidity, and other relevant metrics.

## Design Goals

- **Visual Clarity:** Use emojis and formatting for quick interpretation.
- **Detail Expansion:** Show wind speed/direction, temperature, humidity, etc.
- **Terminal Compatibility:** Output remains readable in all terminals; emojis are optional if unsupported.
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new metrics or icons in future.

## Output Example

```
🌤️ Weather for Madrid, ES

🌡️ Temperature: 27°C (Feels like 29°C)
💨 Wind: 15 km/h NW
💧 Humidity: 60%
🔆 UV Index: 5 (Moderate)
🌦️ Condition: Partly Cloudy
```

## Implementation Notes

- Use Unicode emojis for weather, units, and metrics.
- Use string interpolation and alignment for clean layout.
- Detect terminal emoji support; fallback to text if needed.
- Extend weather DTO/model to include new metrics if available from API.
- Add formatting logic to weather output handler.

## Dependencies

- Weather command handler (F2.3)
- Output formatting and units option (F2.4)

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Emoji support:** Fallback to text if not supported.
- **API data gaps:** Gracefully handle missing metrics.
