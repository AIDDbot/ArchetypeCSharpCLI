# Feature: Enhanced Human-Friendly Weather Report

## Context

The CLI currently provides weather information using basic output formatting. To improve user experience, the weather report should be more visually engaging and detailed, including:
- Emojis for weather conditions and units
- Expanded details: wind speed/direction, temperature, humidity, etc.
- Clear, readable layout for console users

## Motivation

Users expect CLI tools to deliver information quickly and clearly. Adding emojis and more details makes the weather report:
- Easier to scan and interpret
- More enjoyable to use
- More informative for decision-making

## Goals

- Add emojis for weather conditions (sun, rain, clouds, etc.)
- Display temperature, wind speed/direction, humidity, and other relevant metrics
- Format output for clarity (tables, alignment, color if possible)
- Maintain support for `--units` and `--raw` options
- Ensure output remains accessible (no loss of information for non-emoji terminals)

## Non-Goals

- No changes to raw JSON output
- No changes to API integration or DTOs

## Dependencies

- F2.3 Weather command handler
- F2.4 Output formatting and units option

## Stakeholders

- CLI end users
- Developers maintaining output formatting

## Acceptance Criteria

- Weather report includes emojis for conditions and units
- Output displays temperature, wind, humidity, and other details
- Output is readable and well-formatted in standard terminals
- Feature is covered by unit tests for formatting and content
